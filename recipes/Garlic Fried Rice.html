Fried Garlic rice, or <strong><em>Sinangag</em></strong> as we call it, is one of the most common rice dishes you will find in Filipino restaurants!
</body>
<p>It is also a favorite way to revamp leftover rice.</p>
<p>The best rice to use is cooked white rice that has been cooled and even refrigerated since the grains are no longer as sticky as compared to freshly cooked rice.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tbsp neutral oil</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt or more to taste if needed</li>
    <li>10 cloves garlic minced</li>
    <li>2 cups rice cooked and cooled (<em>leftover is best</em>)</li>
</ul>
<H2>Steps</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a large wok or non-stick pan over medium high heat. Once hot, add in the oil. Add in the salt and mix into the oil.</li>
    <li>Add in the garlic and cook over medium heat until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add in the leftover cooked and cooled rice, and break apart any large chunks, if there are any. Mix the rice into the oil and garlic and leave to cook for 4-5 minutes over medium high heat. Feel free to season with more salt, to taste, if youâ€™d like.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and enjoy with your favorite ulam</li>
</ol>
